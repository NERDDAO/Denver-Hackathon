# Split allocator

#### What everyone needs to know[​](#what-everyone-needs-to-know "Direct link to What everyone needs to know")

- A project's payout distribution splits or its reserved token distribution splits can be directed at custom allocator contracts.
- An allocator can be attached to a project's split during any funding cycle configuration to automate the routing of treasury funds and reserved project tokens.
- An allocator's `allocate(...)` transaction is triggered automatically when the split is receiving funds.

#### What you'll want to know if you're building[​](#what-youll-want-to-know-if-youre-building "Direct link to What you'll want to know if you're building")

- An allocator contract must adhere to the [`IJBSplitsAllocator`](/dev/api/interfaces/ijbsplitallocator/) interface.
- An allocator can be specified in a split through the [`JBController3_1.launchProjectFor(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller3_1/#launchprojectfor), [`JBController3_1.reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller3_1/#reconfigurefundingcyclesof), or [`JBSplitStore.set(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/jbsplitsstore/write/set/).
